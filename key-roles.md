## **What do we mean?**

There are four (4) roles that are specific to implementing JustOrg Design. It is not possible to fully implement JustOrg Design as intended without people stepping with energy and consistency into these roles. However, none of these roles is permanent. They can all rotate over time to adjust to people’s capacity and to give new people opportunities for leadership development. They are:

1. **Table Participants**\
   Attend Table meetings; engage thoughtfully; hold power consciously; interpret strategy; learn; influence and be influenced; participate in decision-making.
2. **Table Conveners**\
   Co-design agendas; co-facilitate conversations; keep the JustOrg Design system current and relevant for your Table(s) Members; stay in open dialogue with your Sponsor(s).
3. **Table Sponsors**\
   Champion Table purpose and progress at the executive level; coach and support Co-Conveners in addressing strategies and Table dynamics effectively.
4. **Organization Administrator (Org Admin)**\
   Maintain the JustOrg Design system for the organization overall, including adding new staff and removing staff who have left. Attend to overall data hygiene.

## **Why is it important?**

JustOrg Design is different from traditional nonprofit and philanthropic structures. It is intended to create frequent strategic spaces that are not led by a single person or positional leader. It purposefully convenes people across functions and levels of positional power so that everyone is proximate to strategy in a meaningful way all the time. For these kinds of conversations and experiences, we need capacities like:

* [ ] Meeting design
* [ ] Facilitation
* [ ] Deep listening
* [ ] Trust in people’s capacity to learn and interpret strategies
* [ ] Alignment and consensus-building
* [ ] A spirit of experimentation / willingness to “fail,” learn, and try again
* [ ] Embodiment of organizational values

Social change strategies are complex and ever-evolving. Our personal identities are intertwined in every conversation we have about them. To actually explore and advance such strategies as a group requires very intentional practices. We need people who are actively developing the capacities above and playing intentional facilitative and participatory roles to sustain this challenging and beautiful work over time.

## **How does it work in the JustOrg Design application?**

Each of the four roles interact with the JustOrg Design application in the specific ways below:

### **Table Participants**

* [ ] Have a unique system log-in
* [ ] Participants can read but not edit detailed information about the Tables on which they participate
* [ ] Participants can receive emailed agendas and meeting notes from their Table Conveners
* [ ] Participants can view but not edit organizational values, strategies, and an array of JustOrg Design reports

### **Table Conveners**

* [ ] All the Table Participants can do, plus…
* [ ] Conveners can create and edit DTBMs
* [ ] Conveners can create, edit, and email meeting agendas and meeting notes

NOTE: The Convener of the Executive Leadership Table can create new Tables and edit their details.

### **Table Sponsors**

* [ ] Table Sponsor has the same permissions as a Table Participant. They do not have the editing permissions that a Convener does.

### **Org Admin**

* [ ] The Org Admin has permissions that allow for initial set-up and ongoing maintenance of the JustOrg Design application. They can add people, add Tables, add strategies, and add values. They can not do anything operational on behalf of Tables once created, e.g. create agendas or DTBMs.

## **What practices do we recommend?**

We recommend taking care to select and support people who are stepping into the four JustOrg Design-specific roles. This includes the following considerations:

**Clarifying the Why**

Making sure that everyone involved understands _why_ your organization is making this change. This is an adaptive change over time, not a one-time fix. The deeper people’s understanding of the motivation and intentions for this work, the more likely they are to lean into it intellectually and emotionally.

**Initial & Ongoing Support**

Making sure that everyone is adequately trained before the launch of Tables. And then, providing regular ongoing support and coaching as they learn by doing in real time.

**Regular Temperature Checks**

Using a mix of dedicated meeting time and online survey tools to gauge progress and to identify needs for course correction, additional training, etc. In the first year of JustOrg Design implementation, these formal check-in instruments should be used at least quarterly.

**Strategy Review & Refinement**

JustOrg Design is, at its core, about and for strategic alignment. When Tables are thriving, they will inevitably find ways to strengthen organizational strategies. Yearly, we recommend that Executive Leadership Team create a space to invite refinements to organizational strategy.

# Defining Organizational Design

For most leaders, the term "organizational design" conjures images of titles, supervision lines, and unwieldy organizational charts. It sounds like traditional human resources work. At JustOrg Design, we mean something very, very different by the term.

We define organizational design as: _**the intentional and ongoing co-activation of organizational strategy, structure, and decision-making.**_&#x20;

Organizational design, as we are using the term, is strategic leadership work. It cannot be captured in a chart or a powerpoint deck. It is an active and ongoing set of choices that leadership makes to ensure everyone is engaged in the most important work the organization can be doing in its movement or field right now.&#x20;

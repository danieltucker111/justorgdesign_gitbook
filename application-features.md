# Application Features

JustOrg Design is a comprehensive organizational design software built specifically for justice-committed organizations. Our platform helps your organization sustain a practice of aligning strategy, structure, and decision-making to help you achieve your purpose with clarity, focus, and adaptability. Here's how our key features can help your organization successfully practice strategic alignment while significantly reducing the cognitive and psychic load traditionally associated with executing strategy:



## Strategy

### Strategy Builder/Manager

Craft and refine your organizational strategies to make them clear and visible to everyone–always. Our collaborative tools guide you through best practices in strategy development, helping your teams to create a cohesive, actionable plan. Within the system, your leadership team can make high-level strategies even more accessible by translating them into concrete priorities, making it simple to cascade your vision throughout the organization. The Strategy Builder/Manager doesn't just store your strategy—it keeps it alive by connecting it to day-to-day decisions and actions. As your organization learns and grows, use our data-driven insights to iteratively refine your strategy, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and strategic thinking.

### Strategic Priority Management

Bridge the gap between lofty goals and on-the-ground execution. Our Strategic Priority Management feature allows you to break down your overarching strategy into tangible, actionable priorities. These priorities serve as a roadmap for your teams, ensuring that every action taken is in service of your larger purpose. By clearly defining strategic priorities, you create a shared sense of direction and accountability, propelling your organization forward with focus and intention.



## Structure

### Table/Structure Manager

Design your organization for maximum impact. The Table/Structure Manager allows you to create a flexible, strategy-aligned structure composed of purposeful teams (which we call "Tables"). For each Table, you'll clearly define its purpose, decision-making authority, key deliverables, and team composition—all explicitly linked to your strategies. This strategic visibility helps everyone understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture. As your strategies evolve, easily adapt your organizational structure to maintain alignment, and leverage the full potential of your talent by enabling fluid movement between Tables based on strengths and development goals.

### Table Planner

Turn strategy into action with our powerful Table Planner. This feature helps teams plan their work, track progress, and stay aligned with organizational strategies. Manage agenda topics based on strategic actions and decisions, ensuring your meetings are always purposeful. Break down complex initiatives into manageable actions, making big goals feel achievable. The Table Planner also serves as a central hub for all table-related documents and logged decisions, providing easy access to critical information and fostering continuity between meetings. By connecting day-to-day work directly to strategic priorities, teams stay in sync as they drive execution - all while maintaining a clear view of how their efforts contribute to the bigger picture.

### Active Organization Design Chart

Visualize your organization's structure and strategy alignment at a glance. This dynamic chart provides a real-time view of how your various Tables and teams connect to active strategies. It's an invaluable tool for communicating your organizational design to stakeholders, helping everyone understand the rationale behind your structure. As your organization evolves, the chart updates automatically, ensuring you always have an accurate, current view of your intentional design.



## Strategy Activation and Decision-Making

### Meeting Space

Vastly improve the quality of meetings and outcomes for your teams . Our Meeting Space feature helps you manage all aspects of your meetings—from logistics and agendas to decisions and follow-up communications. By ensuring continuity and preparation between meetings, you'll maximize engagement and productivity whether your team is meeting in-person, remotely, or in a hybrid setting. The Meeting Space integrates seamlessly with your existing workflows, making it easy to adopt and use consistently across your organization. With built-in best practices and resources, you'll foster a strong meeting culture that drives strategy activation and inclusive collaboration.

### Capture Board & Sensemaking

Unlock your team's collective intelligence with our Capture Board & Sensemaking feature. This digital collaboration space allows teams to brainstorm and build upon ideas simultaneously, breaking down silos and fostering innovation. As ideas flow, use our prioritization and bundling tools to uncover patterns and insights. The ability to clarify and modify ideas in real-time ensures that your team's thinking evolves collaboratively. When the session ends, easily export your boards and sense-making outcomes to your centralized meeting notes, ensuring that valuable insights are captured and actionable.

### Group Voting

Make inclusive, transparent decisions with our Group Voting feature. Whether you're making decisions in real-time during a meeting or preparing proposals in advance, our flexible voting system ensures that all voices are heard. Choose from consent, consensus, or majority voting methods to best suit your organization's culture and the decision at hand. The collaborative voting process, managed by a Vote Admin, promotes honest feedback while maintaining transparency. After voting, hold focused workshops to discuss results and modify proposals as needed. Once finalized, seamlessly convert proposals into logged decisions that are visible and actionable across the system in a few clicks, ensuring follow-through and accountability.

### Realtime Decision Capture

Foster a culture of clear, collaborative decision-making with our Realtime Decision Capture feature. Implement standardized workflows for proposing and documenting decisions, ensuring that the right stakeholders are always included through flexible voting options. By tying each decision to relevant strategies, priorities, values, and impacted teams, you create a rich context that helps everyone understand the rationale behind choices. All decisions are stored in a centralized repository, making it easy to reference past decisions and track their outcomes. Over time, gain valuable insights into your decision-making patterns, identifying areas for improvement and learning.

### Org-wide Decision Manager

Transform decision-making from a point-in-time event to an ongoing, strategic process. Our Org-wide Decision Manager allows you to organize decisions using custom tags and archiving, keeping your focus on active, relevant choices. For each decision, access full context, notes, and impacts in one place, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks. Powerful search and filtering capabilities make it easy to find and reference past decisions, informing future planning. Use tags to create custom workflows that drive communication and execution, turning decisions into action. By centralizing and activating your organization's choices, you'll improve consistency, follow-through, and strategic alignment across all levels.

### Community Member Participation

Amplify the voices of those you serve with our Community Member Participation feature. Easily include community representatives on relevant cross-functional tables, ensuring their perspectives are integrated into your strategy and structure. This feature allows you to collaborate with community partners in an organized, intentional way, strengthening relationships and improving the relevance and effectiveness of your work. By systematically incorporating community voice into your decision-making processes, you'll stay true to your organizational purpose and create more impactful, sustainable solutions.

## Support Features to Improve Experience

### Your Dashboard

Stay on top of your commitments and your teams' progress with Your Dashboard. This personalized hub gives you a single view of all your commitments across the organization, helping you manage your time and priorities effectively. See at a glance the key actions each of your tables is currently focused on, ensuring you're always prepared for upcoming discussions. Quick access to your upcoming meetings keeps you organized and ready to contribute meaningfully to each session. Your Dashboard turns the complexity of organizational work into a clear, actionable overview tailored just for you.

### Document Link Library

Say goodbye to version control nightmares and endless searches for the right file. Our Document Link Library centralizes file management within the context of each table, streamlining collaboration and ensuring everyone has access to the most up-to-date information. By integrating with your existing file-sharing platforms, we maintain your established access and security controls while providing a clear work context for every document. This feature transforms how your tables operate, keeping everyone on the same page and reducing time wasted on administrative tasks.

### Values Capture

Ensure your organization's values are more than just words on a wall. The Values Capture feature allows you to link each decision to the specific values it advances, creating a tangible record of how your choices reflect your principles in practice. By keeping values top of mind during group decision-making, you reinforce their importance and create a culture of intentional, values-driven action. Over time, gain insights into how consistently your choices align with your stated values, allowing for reflection and course-correction if needed.

### Reporting

Turn data into actionable insights with our comprehensive Reporting feature. Visualize your organizational structure, strategic alignment, and decision-making patterns to gain a holistic understanding of your operations. Generate easy-to-understand reports to keep stakeholders informed and engaged. Because our system compiles data from actual usage, you'll save time and gain authentic insights into how your organization really functions. Use these insights to identify areas for optimization in your strategy, structure, and processes, driving continuous improvement across your organization.

# Structure: Table Meeting Design & Facilitation

## **What do we mean?**

By Table Meeting design and facilitation, we mean the intentional creation of an agenda that is distributed prior to a Table Meeting and intended to engage Table Members in a strategic conversation. When we design an agenda, we consider four things: meeting objectives, meeting attendees, meeting topics, and meeting engagement techniques.

1.  **What is the purpose, or objective, of this particular Table Meeting?**\
    \
    For instance, do we want to explore a topic? Do we want to generate specific options for action? Do we want to come to a decision?

    \
    _Example:_ The objective of this Table Meeting is to explore possibilities for expanding our approach to healing for impacted community members.

    \
    _Example:_ The objective of this Table Meeting is to come to a decision on whether to partner with the XYZ Justice Group on our 2023 Advocacy Days.\

2. **Who will attend the Table Meeting?**\
   \
   Will all Table Members be in attendance? Do we want to include anyone beyond the Table Members for this particular conversation? This could be other staff, community members, or board members. This is not necessary, but depending on the strategic conversation you want to have, may enrich the discussion.\

3. **What topics will we cover in the Table Meeting?**\
   \
   You’ll want to break the conversation into clear topics that build toward accomplishing the Table Meeting’s objective(s). For instance, you might start with an agenda review and check-in question to get the group warmed up. You might next go to one Table Member providing a brief history of what the organization has done historically on the topic being explored. Then you might have a round of clarifying questions. Then you might have a full group discussion of options for where the organization could go next. Finally, you might close the meeting with a check-out question to offer everyone a chance to make the connection between the conversation you just had and their own work ahead. Each of these items is an agenda topic; they all build toward a deep group experience of exploring options to activate a strategy.\

4.  **What engagement techniques will we use to ensure participants are engaged in the Table Meeting?**\
    \
    For instance, is there any preparation we want attendees to do in advance so that people feel better prepared? What facilitation techniques will we incorporate in the agenda design so that everyone gets involved and is supported to share their views if they wish to?

    \
    _Example:_ This Table Meeting will begin with a check-in question related to the meeting topic; each person will have 1 minute to check in.

    \
    _Example:_ This Table Meeting will include paired break-outs before the full group discussion so that everyone has 15 minutes to think with someone else before suggesting options for action to the full group.

## **Why is it important?**

Table Meeting design and facilitation are absolutely essential to the quality of strategic conversations at Tables, and thus to organizational strategic alignment. People need time in advance to prepare for complex conversations about strategy. People also need support during meetings to bring their voices to the conversation, especially people who may be less experienced in strategic discussions or who have less positional power in the organization. Intentional meeting design and facilitation by the Co-Conveners supports all participants to show up with purpose to the conversation.

## **How does it work in the JustOrg Design application?**

When a Convener clicks to add an Agenda, they are brought to the Agenda screen. It has a number of features that support the design and facilitation of strategy-focused Table Meetings, including:

1. **Attendees:** All Table Members are automatically listed as attendees; simply remove anyone who cannot attend. If you want to add staff who are not Table Members simply click in the Staff field and scroll to their name. There are also fields to add board members, community members, and a general other field if you ever want to include non-staff members in a Table Meeting.
2. **Meeting Purpose or Objectives:** There is a dedicated field to capture the high-level intentions of the meeting; that is, what you want to accomplish whether that is exploration, decision-making, etc.
3. **Meeting Topics:** There is a section for adding meeting topics one by one, including their length of time. You’ll notice a helpful meeting duration tracker in the upper right of this section; it auto tabulates the length of the meeting as you add and edit topics. There is also a sorting feature in the bottom left of this section if you decide you want to keep topics you have entered but move them around.
4. **Related Strategies & Decisions-to-be-Made:** Below the meeting topics section, you will find a section for adding the organizational strategy(s) relevant to this particular meeting. This is to continuously keep strategy at the center of the conversation. And to the right, you can add as reference any decisions-to-be-made that the Table has open if they will be discussed in this particular meeting. Again, these two fields are meant to keep everyone focused on strategy and decision-making.
5. **Note-taking and Distribution:** At the bottom of the meeting agenda screen there is a note that only Conveners can see; it reads, “To add meeting notes and decisions made click here.” When Conveners click the add button, two additional fields pop up: Real-time Decisions and Meeting Notes. The former is to capture any decisions that the Table makes in real-time during the meeting rather than creating a DTBM. The latter is where the non-facilitating Co-Convener captures high-level notes as the meeting progresses. There is both a mini-view and long-view option for taking notes. After the meeting, once the notes are reviewed and ready to share, the Convener can hit the agenda email send button and Table Members will receive the agenda again with the notes attached as a final record of the meeting.

## **What practices do we recommend?**

* [ ] Focusing agendas on the strategic issues and questions rather than project details
* [ ] Agendas sent two or more days in advance
* [ ] Intentional techniques for engaging Table Members built into agenda topics, including from this list:
  * [ ] Pre-reading if relevant
  * [ ] Reviewing group agreements
  * [ ] Reviewing table purpose and assigned strategies
  * [ ] Check-in questions
  * [ ] Personal reflection time
  * [ ] Pairs or small group discussions
  * [ ] Presentation by a Table Member(s) to convey information
  * [ ] Go around the Table without cross-talk (let people know they can pass if they like)
  * [ ] Open group discussion
  * [ ] Making a decision
  * [ ] Check-out questions
* [ ] Linking meetings agendas to one or more organizational strategies
* [ ] One Co-Convener facilitates while the other captures notes
* [ ] Periodically dedicating meeting time to check-in on the quality of Table Meetings and get ideas to nurture participant engagement

# Strategy

## **What do we mean?**

In JustOrg Design, we think of strategy as the _current_—the common energy source that orients and propels the diverse, passionate hearts and minds of an organization. We like the analogy of the momentum of a strong river current as well as the second meaning of current as “of this time.”

In other words, strategy is what we _currently_ believe to be the best ways to approach our work given everything going on in and around our organization and the movements we work in. We know these approaches must and will evolve over time.

Some might argue that values are the current, but our experience teaches us otherwise.

Values are essential. But without a shared commitment to a set of strategies that embody those values and further direct and propel how we’ll approach the work we take on together, deep alignment—and thus sustained impact—elude us.

We think leaders in justice-driven organizations are, or need to be, combining three mutually reinforcing tenets of strategy: what we practice, how we create change, and what attracts resources.

The three writers/practitioners below guide us in thinking in these three complementary ways about strategy.

1. adrienne maree brown: [Emergent Strategy](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html)\
   \
   adrienne maree brown takes the natural world and the science fiction of Octavia Butler as guides and offers us inspiration on strategy as intentional practice. \
   \
   Key Insight: “Emergent strategies let us practice, in every possible way, the world we want to see.”\

2.  Jara Dean-Coffey: [A Master Class for Linking Strategy & Evaluation](https://store.nonprofitquarterly.org/products/evaluative-practice-a-master-class-for-nonprofit-leaders-on-linking-strategy-and-evaluation)

    \
    Dean-Coffey and her firm [jdcParterships](https://www.jdcpartnerships.com/offerings) employ a theory-of-change (evaluative) framework and offer us inspiration on strategy as core methods for pursuing the change we seek.

    \
    Key Insight: “Strategies are cross-cutting methods/means used to work toward the change the organization seeks.”\

3.  Roger Martin: [A Plan Is Not A Strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuYlGRnC7J8)\
    \
    Martin writes about for-profit strategy and offers us inspiration on strategy as risk-taking in pursuit of a resource advantage.

    \
    Key Insight: “Strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.”

As distinct as these three practitioners may seem, they share a conceptualization of strategy as an organization's _theory_ of how a set of behaviors and approaches, if applied rigorously, can result in meaningful change.

## **Why is it important?**

Organizational strategy transcends positional power, functional departments, job descriptions, and budget line items. It’s bigger, more cross-cutting, and more unifying than any of those things. It's the primary source of both alignment and accountability across all of an organization's work. \

\
Without compelling strategy, we are unmoored; mistrust and conflict ensue as people inevitably make conflicting assumptions about what to do and employ divergent methods to do it. That’s why strategy is the centerpiece of organizational design as we define it.

Strategy is also the basis of strong decision-making. Decisions as seemingly small as which caterer to use for a convening to as seemingly big as whether to discontinue a long-held program should be explicitly tied to strategy.

By making decisions consciously and explicitly in light of strategy, we learn and in turn can iterate our strategies to be even more relevant, or _current_.

## **How does it work in the JustOrg Design application?**

Again, strategy is _central_ to the entire JustOrg Design process and software. It is supported in multiple ways in the application, including:

1. **Capture Strategies:** The application is where you capture and update your organizational strategies so that they are always current and always accessible. They should no longer be kept in disparate documents and PPT decks to which few people have access. Strategies, like values, are captured on the left navigation bar of the application under the heading, Org Frame.
2. **Associate Strategies with a Table:** In the Table Details section associated with every Table, there is a field called, Activates Strategy(s). This is a drop-down menu that includes all of the current organizational strategies. Here, you can identify which strategy or strategies the Table is particularly charged with activating.
3. **Associate Strategies with a Meeting Topic:** In Section Two of the Agenda Builder, you will find a field called Meeting Related Strategies and DTBMs. This is where the Convener of the meeting can alert participants that the meeting’s topics will reference one or more organizational strategies. This helps to keep strategy front and center as participants are engaging in the agenda discussions.
4. **Associate Strategies with a Decision-to-be-Made (DTBM):** In the DTBM Details section associated with every DTBM, there is a field called, Activates Strategy(s). This is a drop-down menu that includes all of the current organizational strategies. Here, you can identify which strategy or strategies the DTBM will activate.
5. **Associate Strategies with a Decision:** When a decision is made and closed in the application, you will be asked which strategy(s) were most amplified by the outcome of this decision. The system will auto-populate the strategy(s) you anticipated at the DTBM phase, but you are able to add or edit this to what actually took place in making the decision.

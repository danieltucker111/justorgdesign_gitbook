# JoD Glossary of Terms

### **An Offering of How to Think About This Language**

The language of organizational strategy has become cliched for its multiplicity of terms. What is a strategy? What is a goal? What is an objective? Each term has a myriad of uses among leaders and consultants. And sometimes, they are meant to be nested; for instance, “objective” may be a subset of “goal.” Confusion inevitably ensues.

Honestly, we know better than to do this to people!

“Researchers have often debated the maximum amount of items we can store in our conscious mind, in what's called our working memory, and a new study puts\
the limit at _three or four_.”

So imagine a group of people with different experience levels and perspectives sitting around a table trying to craft powerful elements of organizational identity. In real time, they are both learning a set of terms–strategy, goals, etc.--_and_ trying to develop the substance for each. Brain science tells us that we must pick a minimal set of learnable terms and stick with them so that people can focus on the substance.

And a second critical point: In _just_ organizational design, our aim is for this core set of organizational identity elements to be fully democratized. That is, every position, every department, every board member, _everyone_ in the organization learns the terms and is empowered to enact their substance in their work every day. For this level of alignment and empowerment to occur, language cannot be a barrier. Instead, our language has to serve as an accessible invitation to view the organization and its purpose as a living, breathing force for good to which each of us is essential.

## **JustOrg Design’s Recommended Terms**

In the spirit of clarity and minimalism, we recommend using the following terms. If they are used thoughtfully and in concert with one another, we believe they offer plenty of opportunity to explain an organization to itself and its community.

### **Organizational Values**

Organizational values articulate the shared beliefs of the organization. They inform everything the organization does from setting strategy to hiring to making decisions in the day-to-day. We like this definition from [CompassPoint](https://www.compasspoint.org/vision-and-values).

**The fundamental, intrinsic beliefs that guide our work.**

DEFINITION

Examples:

* Liberation for everyone is both necessary and possible. (Trasngender Law Center)
* Belonging: We feel safety, joy, and connection when we are in community with one another. (API Equality-LA)
* Anti-Racism: We commit to shifting power away from white supremacy, repairing harm, and ending structural racism. (Sierra Club)
* Anti-capitalist: We believe and understand that Black people will never achieve liberation under the current global racialized capitalist system. (Movement for Black Lives)

Values Guidance:

* Contrary to much of the historical guidance on organizational values, they can and likely will change as our analysis of root causes and potential solutions change.
* Adding a short description of how the value shows up in practice, as some of the examples above do, can illuminate the belief further and promote accountability.
* You will notice that values and strategies (see below) are complementary; some overlap is a reinforcement of key aspects of organizational identity, not a problem, so long as you do it thoughtfully.\


### **Organizational Strategy** 

Strategy is intentionally reserved as a term used at the _organizational_ level. Our favorite definition of strategy comes from the work of Jara Dean Coffey at [Luminare Group](https://www.theluminaregroup.com/resources).

**The distinctive, cross-cutting approaches we take to our work to**\
**create the change we seek.**

DEFINITION

Examples:

* We engage our clients and stakeholders as changemakers.
* We ally with and resource grassroots partners.
* We nurture cross-generational relationships and mutual support.

Guidance:

* Strategies are not department or program specific.
* Strategies are not neutral; they are expressions of our values.
* Strategies are methods, means, ways of working and being that we believe are essential to the change we seek in the world.

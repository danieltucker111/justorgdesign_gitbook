# Structure

## **What do we mean?**

One of the central tenets of JustOrg Design is that structure is a lever, a powerful opportunity to organize and reorganize people to activate justice strategies together. Structure is not only about who reports to whom. Or, how much someone is compensated. Or how long a person's tenure is. It's as much, or more, about what they an bring now to the most pressing strategic challenges the organization is embracing.

The vast majority of justice-committed leaders have replicated or inherited the organizational  structure below.

A central problem for justice-committed organizations with this traditional, vertical design is that justice strategies are inherently interdisciplinary and experimental, or what in organizational design is called, “horizontal.” Such strategies require collaboration across roles, program areas, power levels, lived expertise, etc.&#x20;

An additional problem is that people working in justice-committed organizations typically want to practice internally the kinds of changes they seek for the world externally. There is a desire for a conscious holding of power, for transparency, for meaningful engagement of people internally and externally who are closest to the issues and most impacted by organizational choices.&#x20;

The bottom line, we believe, is that an organizational structure that consists only of functional hierarchies will not yield ongoing strategic innovation, alignment, and momentum in a justice-focused context.

Rather than thinking of and representing organizational structure in purely positional authority terms, we lead with organizational purpose and current organizational strategies. Structure, in a JustOrg Design, is how we will configure ourselves to activate our strategies in service of our purpose.

A critical element of structure is the Table. Tables are configurations of people from across functional areas to advance a body of work. Tables give us way to convene people other than within supervisorial or departmental lines. They are essential to collaboartion\


## **How does it work in the JustOrg Design application?**

When a Convener clicks to add an Agenda, they are brought to the Agenda screen. It has a number of features that support the design and facilitation of strategy-focused Table Meetings, including:

1. **Attendees:** All Table Members are automatically listed as attendees; simply remove anyone who cannot attend. If you want to add staff who are not Table Members simply click in the Staff field and scroll to their name. There are also fields to add board members, community members, and a general other field if you ever want to include non-staff members in a Table Meeting.
2. **Meeting Purpose or Objectives:** There is a dedicated field to capture the high-level intentions of the meeting; that is, what you want to accomplish whether that is exploration, decision-making, etc.
3. **Meeting Topics:** There is a section for adding meeting topics one by one, including their length of time. You’ll notice a helpful meeting duration tracker in the upper right of this section; it auto tabulates the length of the meeting as you add and edit topics. There is also a sorting feature in the bottom left of this section if you decide you want to keep topics you have entered but move them around.
4. **Related Strategies & Decisions-to-be-Made:** Below the meeting topics section, you will find a section for adding the organizational strategy(s) relevant to this particular meeting. This is to continuously keep strategy at the center of the conversation. And to the right, you can add as reference any decisions-to-be-made that the Table has open if they will be discussed in this particular meeting. Again, these two fields are meant to keep everyone focused on strategy and decision-making.
5. **Note-taking and Distribution:** At the bottom of the meeting agenda screen there is a note that only Conveners can see; it reads, “To add meeting notes and decisions made click here.” When Conveners click the add button, two additional fields pop up: Real-time Decisions and Meeting Notes. The former is to capture any decisions that the Table makes in real-time during the meeting rather than creating a DTBM. The latter is where the non-facilitating Co-Convener captures high-level notes as the meeting progresses. There is both a mini-view and long-view option for taking notes. After the meeting, once the notes are reviewed and ready to share, the Convener can hit the agenda email send button and Table Members will receive the agenda again with the notes attached as a final record of the meeting.

## **What practices do we recommend?**

* [ ] Focusing agendas on the strategic issues and questions rather than project details
* [ ] Agendas sent two or more days in advance
* [ ] Intentional techniques for engaging Table Members built into agenda topics, including from this list:
  * [ ] Pre-reading if relevant
  * [ ] Reviewing group agreements
  * [ ] Reviewing table purpose and assigned strategies
  * [ ] Check-in questions
  * [ ] Personal reflection time
  * [ ] Pairs or small group discussions
  * [ ] Presentation by a Table Member(s) to convey information
  * [ ] Go around the Table without cross-talk (let people know they can pass if they like)
  * [ ] Open group discussion
  * [ ] Making a decision
  * [ ] Check-out questions
* [ ] Linking meetings agendas to one or more organizational strategies
* [ ] One Co-Convener facilitates while the other captures notes
* [ ] Periodically dedicating meeting time to check-in on the quality of Table Meetings and get ideas to nurture participant engagement

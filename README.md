# JustOrg Design Process Guide

**Our mission is to help organizations operationalize their values and strategies through structure and decision-making.**

In justice organizations, our expectations of work structures and processes are fundamentally different than in mainstream nonprofits and philanthropies. We created JustOrg Design specifically for leaders actively rethinking traditional ways of holding power and working to distribute decision-making in concert with their values of inclusion and justice.

We take as inspiration what the the renowned abolitionist and scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore recently said:

> If consciousness is the means through which we imagine ourselves into the future then organizations are the form.

**JustOrg Design is the missing linkage: strategy →  structure → decision-making**

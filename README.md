**Our mission is to help organizations operationalize their values and strategies through structure and decision-making.**

We take as inspiration what the the renowned abolitionist and scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore recently said:

> If consciousness is the means through which we imagine ourselves into the future then organizations are the form.

JustOrg Design helps everyone at a justice organization to understand and participate in the activation of organizational strategies. That ever-deepening understanding and activation across all functions and levels of the organization nurtures critical discussion, debate, alignment, and momentum.

This Process Guide walks readers through the fundamentals of JustOrg Design:

* [ ] Strategy
* [ ] Structure (Tables)
* [ ] Decision-making
* [ ] Key Roles

For each topic, we explore four questions:

1. What do we mean?
2. Why is it important?
3. How does it work in the JustOrg Design application?
4. What practices do we recommend?

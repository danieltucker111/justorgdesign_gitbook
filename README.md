# Welcome from the Co-Founders

At JustOrg Design, our purpose is to cultivate and sustain the practice of strategic alignment in justice-committed organizations.

We take as inspiration what the the renowned abolitionist and scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore recently said:

> If consciousness is the means through which we imagine ourselves into the future, then organizations are the form.



JustOrg Design ensures everyone at a justice-committed organization understands and participates in the activation of organizational strategies. This ever-deepening understanding and activation across all functions and levels of the organization nurtures shared leadership, alignment, conscious decision-making, and ultimately, greater social impact.

This Process Guide walks readers through the fundamentals of JustOrg Design:

* [ ] Defining Organizational Design&#x20;
* [ ] Strategy&#x20;
* [ ] Structure&#x20;
* [ ] Decision-making&#x20;
* [ ] Key Roles&#x20;
* [ ] Application Features&#x20;
* [ ] Resources

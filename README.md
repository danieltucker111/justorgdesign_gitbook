# What is a JustOrg Design?

## What is a JustOrg Design

Let’s start with a question. In the last 5 years, how many times have you been part of conversations like the ones below?

* Do we really need a management team anymore? What do they actually do? Can it function equitably?
* Is our internal racial equity work best led by a single position? By a task force? By a standing cross-departmental team?
* Human Resources is so much more than payroll and compliance now. Do we need an Employee Wellness Team?
* Should we have a decision-making ethos and method that is organization-wide? If so, should it be consensus or modified consensus or majority or something else?
* Are there any decisions that our executive director(s) alone can make? Is it more that they have veto power when the stakes are high?

We could go on, but we think you get a sense of the kinds of conversations we mean. If your answer is “I have been in a whole lot of these types of conversations,” then this guide is written directly to you.We too have been part of many, many of these types of conversations. Both as leaders and consultants to leaders. And here’s what we have come to realize\*\*.\*\*Leaders in progressive organizations are in a constant state of organizational design.What do we mean by “organizational design”? We mean all of the steps we take as leaders to make our organizational structure and decision-making more reflective of our values and more conducive to driving social justice strategies. Here’s a short list of the kind of steps we mean:

* re-configuring and/or sunsetting leadership teams
* re-configuring and/or sunsetting departments
* creating a racial justice team or task force
* moving from a single executive to co-executive directors
* creating task forces to reimagine key systems like hiring, compensation, or employee development
* adopting new methods for meeting design and facilitation
* adopting new methods for clear decision-making
* adopting new methods for community participation in decision-making

So as progressive leaders, why are we in this seemingly constant state of organizational design? Because as progressive people, we are deeply concerned with not replicating systems of oppression inside as we work to upend oppression outside. Through the design and redesign of our organizational structures and practices, we are experimenting with ways of distributing power. Ways of centering historically excluded people in our decision-making. Ways of transmuting the evocative language of our values and strategies into actually different ways of being and doing.It’s powerful to pause and reflect on how much organizational design work you and your colleagues have already done. To honor how challenging this work is. To own how sometimes your design efforts moved your organization forward and sometimes they actually caused harm.The truth is “organizational design” is nobody’s job, is it? Leaders and leadership teams engage in it regularly but…YOUR JoD work is ONGOING AND SO IS OUR STUDY OF AND PURPOSE-DRIVEN NATURE OF THIS PROCESS AND APP. THAT’S ALL WE ARE FOCUSED ON.

> “Colonial, white supremacist organizational practices seem inevitable…and they still govern the great majority of our institutions, but they were design choices. This means that other choices are available, even when they seem far-fetched. We know what organizations look like, feel like, and function like when they are inspired by the colonizers’ principles of separation, competition, and exploitation. How would organizations’ design choices be different if they were based on principles like integration and interdependence, reciprocity, and relationship?”-Decolonizing Wealth: Indigenous Wisdom to Heal Divides and Restore BalanceManuel Pastor

As with all collective groupings (families, teams, workforce groupings), culture can shift in an instant… Focusing questions like “who benefits from this decision or action?” And a clear definition of culture (one I like: “everything that a group chooses to celebrate, commemorate, or tolerate), this board uses curiosity, play and a focus on #1 to help maintain perspective.

> “A Racial Equity Impact Assessment (REIA) is a systematic examination of how different racial and ethnic groups will likely be affected by a proposed action or decision. REIAs are used to minimize unanticipated adverse consequences in a variety of contexts, including the analysis of proposed policies, institutional practices, programs, plans and budgetary decisions. The REIA can be a vital tool for preventing institutional racism and for identifying new options to remedy long-standing inequities.”

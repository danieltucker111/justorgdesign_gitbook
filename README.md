# Welcome from the Co-Founders

At JustOrg Design, our purpose is to cultivate and sustain the practice of strategic alignment in justice-committed organizations.

We take as inspiration what the the renowned abolitionist and scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore recently said:

> If consciousness is the means through which we imagine ourselves into the future, then organizations are the form.



JustOrg Design ensures everyone at a justice-committed organization understands and participates in the activation of organizational strategies. Ever-deepening understanding and activation of strategy across all functions and levels of the organization nurtures alignment, shared leadership, conscious decision-making, and ultimately, greater social impact.

This Process Guide walks readers through the fundamentals of JustOrg Design:

   2. Teams and Tables
